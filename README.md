BOSMO is an ergonomic product business located in Deiyandara, Matara, Sri Lanka that focuses on selling hard-to-find ergonomic products to both the local community and through their website online. BOSMO is owned by Neruka Bangamuwage and Ishan Jayalath.
BOSMO will use two sales channels and focus on selling niche products that solve ergonomic health problems that have become more common as people use computers more and more in their daily workdays. By using traditional local marketing and sales techniques, BOSMO will establish a solid local customer base in the home office, small business, and large business communities. To supplement the business and take advantage of manufacturer relationships that include drop-shipping, BOSMO will have a website that has both an online store and an educational section to teach people about ergonomic problems.
BOSMO has a conservative financial plan with low expenses, low payroll, and a conservative sales forecast. BOSMO will always maintain a positive cash balance while slowly growing the total cash and company net worth.


Mission
BOSMO is a specialty ergonomic product retailer in both the local market and in the online space. We aim to provide quality products to satisfy our customers desire to work in a healthy work environment that keeps them injury and pain-free. Keeping our customers happy and solving their problems by providing great products at an affordable price is our goal.
We also take pride in educating our customers on ergonomic issues that they might not be aware of, to prevent them from experiencing pain and discomfort in the future as well. We find doing this is rewarding in a personal and business sense.




Keys to Success
•	Provide excellent customer service. It is difficult to find customers who are aware enough of the health issues of standard office work to realize they need ergonomic products. So, once we find these customers, we need to keep them happy and keep them coming back to us for future products they need.
•	Keep our growth slow and organic so we can make sure we keep expenses low and operate efficiently.
•	Build an easy-to-use website that educates our customers and potential customers while also selling our products effectively.

Objectives
•	Be the market share leader of specialty ergonomic products in the local market. There is no official measurement, but it should be relatively easy to guess how our few competitors are doing.
•	Have our website be one of the top five websites for specialty ergonomic products measured by both traffic and sales. Unfortunately, we cannot get sales statistics for other competing sites, but we can judge by their traffic levels based on their search engine placement, pay per click advertising, links into their site, and Google Page rank. From there we can guess at how well their site converts visitors into sales.
•	Have fun helping our customers work in a safer and more comfortable work environment.



Company Summary 


BOSMO is a small business based in Matara District, CA that sells specialty ergonomic products to local businesses and home office workers while also selling those products on their website online. The company is operated out of the home of owners Neruka and Ishan.

Company Ownership
BOSMO is a private C corporation owned by Neruka Bangamuwage and Ishan Jayalath. They each own 50% of the company.
Start-up Summary
BOSMO will require total start-up expenses which include legal fees in setting up the business, stationery, sales brochures and collateral, insurance, expensed computer equipment, and a domain name.
Neruka and Ishan will be providing the investment which will cover the start-up expenses while also leaving a cash reserve. We have no start-up liabilities to be considered in our start-up phase. We will purchase examples of our products, as Current Assets, for customers to test-sit, but we will have very little inventory on hand.

Products

BOSMO sells niche ergonomic products that are hard to find at standard office furniture or office supply stores. Our primary products include:
•	Boxes – Finished wooden treasure chest (4 x 3 x 3 Inches)


Market Analysis Summary 

these products are often hard to find at general furniture stores or office supply stores. BOSMO aims to supply these products to both our local market and in the online space.
Specifically, we will target a few different types of worker:
•	Small business
•	Shops.
•	The large organization.

Competition and Buying Patterns
People shopping for ergonomic products choose their retailer based on the following criteria:
Product selection: They want to work with a company that provides a few ergonomic products to choose from, including competing brands.
Price: Nobody wants to pay more than they must, and generally ergonomic products are more expensive than people anticipate, so price is usually a big issue.
Customer Service: People usually have questions before purchasing an ergonomic product because, for the most part, they have never seen or worked with the product before. This means that our website must explain things well and make it easy to contact us. We also must provide great customer service locally to keep our clients educated and happy.


Strategy and Implementation Summary
The primary strategies of BOSMO are:
•	Sell niche ergonomic products that are hard to find in normal sales channels and usually take some education to understand and use.
•	Educate our customers and nurture relationships with them by providing superior customer service.
•	Sell locally and online to maximize two different sales channels.
 Competitive Edge
The primary competitive edge of BOSMO is our product selection and how we educate our customers. We carry hard-to-find products that solve specific ergonomic needs. These are products you cannot find at local office furniture stores or superstores such as Office Depot, Staples, etc. These products are only carried by a few ergonomic specialty retailers both locally and online. In our local market, there are only a few small office supply stores that carry these products, and they are not very active in selling them or educating their customers about them.
We will have samples of a range of our products on hand for our local customers to test-sit. Part of the education process is giving people the kinesthetic experience of using properly designed and sized chairs, workstations, etc. Purchases will be drop-shipped directly from the manufacturers to the customers, or to us, as our customers prefer. 
Online, we hope to educate our customers better than anyone else and show why they need our products and how these will help solve their problems. There are lots of websites that carry ergonomic products, but most of them just list the products and don’t give much information about them. 



Marketing Strategy
Our marketing strategy has two categories that both hit our three target markets:
Local Marketing Strategy – We intend to hit our three target markets locally “the old-fashioned way.” 
•	Cold Calls –call on local businesses both small and large to educate them on our company and our ergonomic products.
•	Yellow Pages – We will be listed in the local yellow pages under office products, office furniture, etc.
•	Business Groups –We will use these contacts to get a foot in the door to build relationships with new customers.
Online Marketing Strategy – Our online marketing strategy will be run by Neruka Bangamuwage who is in charge of our website.
•	Search Engines – We will pay to be listed in all the paid inclusion search engines and directories, as well as submitting to all the free search engines.
•	Pay-per-click Advertising – We will be spending a limited monthly budget on pay-per-click advertising on Overture and Google for targeted ergonomic keywords.
•	Link-building Campaign – Our website will be more than just an online store. We will provide tons of information about ergonomics that will be educational for people trying to solve health problems. This will make our site an ergonomic resource worth linking to from other websites. We will have an ergonomic resources directory that will allow us to do link exchanges with other websites.
•	Word of Mouth – We will have features on our site to allow users to send pages from our site to their friends or co-workers.
Sales Strategy
Our sales strategy is broken down into two different areas:
•	Local Sales – We will sell to local customers and employ a traditional local business sales strategy. 
•	Online Sales – Obviously, selling online is different from selling locally. We will rely on our website to provide product information and answer the questions customers have about their products. 




Development Requirements
The development of the BOSMO website will start on October 15th of 2020. Neruka Bangamuwage will be developing all aspects of the website.
•	Front End – The front end of the website is the graphic user design and interface that will be designed by WordPress. The design will be simple with bland colors and feature a similar interface of popular e-commerce websites.
•	Back End – The back end of our system is also being developed by Neruka Bangamuwage. It will feature a mySQL database and will use PHP as the programming language for the site logic. 
•	Administration – It will be easy to add and edit content and product information on the website due to the administrative interface programmed. Owners will be able to add/edit/delete products and content at any time.
